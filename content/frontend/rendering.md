# SPA

Also known as Single-Page Applications, these have been popularized by React, and are still heavily in use today by many applications around the web. In an SPA, your website is loaded as an empty `index.html` file, and all content is loaded by JavaScript in the user's browser. One advantage of SPA websites is the control over interactivity. However, a big disadvantage with SPA's is that all content is loaded after the initial page load, this impacts search engine optimization (SEO), but it also causes multiple round-trips to servers that could have been reduce to one round-trip.

# SSR

Server-side rendered applications are the hot stuff nowadays. Back in the old days, all web applications were rendered on the server. If you have ever used PHP, you'll probably know how [web servers](/frontend/web-servers) handled this.
