title: The Webamboos Guidebook
---

Welcome! Glad you found your way to our Guidebook. You may be asking what you'll find here, and we'll gladly answer that curiosity. We are big advocates of [lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning), so we decided to create and share some sort of learning resource for newbies and veterans alike in the web community.

## ⭐ A brief introduction

The **Webamboos Guidebook** is a collection of learning resources. As the web is vast and the technology advances quickly, we want to build a good knowledge foundation for everyone trying to get into web development, but also software engineering as a whole.

While the guidebook is written for beginners, our philosophy does not exclude practicants with years of experience, we want to write interesting information for everyone. You never know what hidden gems you'll find!

> **Go explore!** Learning is not linear, not even this guidebook. *Please*, click through all the links you find, try to build your own mental model of all the knowledge you can get. When you get back to a topic, everything will feel familiar!

Before delving into technical information, we'll first visit the [the Mindset](/mindset/problem-solving). We'll show you why an engineer is a *problem solver*, how he takes decisions and why factors other than code need to be taken into account when creating new solutions.

In the second chapter of the Guidebook you'll jump into the [Fundamentals](/fundamentals/the-web). Everything is interconnected (also why we chose to show you the nice graph on the side), having a good grasp of the fundamentals will allow you to go way beyond just the basics. Understanding the building blocks will show you how simple the web actually is.

Chapter three introduces the first actual technical challenges, and we'll start by building a simple [Backend](/backend/servers) server. This chapter will show you how to build a simple server, how to handle [requests](/backend/requests), [responses](/backend/requests#responses), connecting and using a [database](/backend/databases), and more.

Todo.
