title: Why it all matters
---

You might have expected a more technical guide, do this, build that, show here. But that's not what this guidebook is, and that's not what a developer does.

In short, the two guiding principles of this guide are:
- The engineering mindset;
- Building of a good foundation.

Firstly, as developers we don't only sit and execute, but we need to understand problems, needs of the target userbase, manage expectation, communicate, collaborate, make decisions, and take the best possible approach when designing and building new solutions.
